## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Download or clone the project files to your local system.

2. **File Setup**:
   Ensure the `assets` folder containing all necessary images (e.g., `intro1.png`, `login.png`, `banner.jpg`) is placed in the project directory.

3. **Run Locally**:
   - Open `Test.html` (or rename it to `index.html`) in a web browser.
   - Ensure the linked `styles.css` and `scripts.js` (if applicable) are in the same directory.

## Known Issues

- **Zooming**: The layout may shift unexpectedly at certain zoom levels (e.g., 100%). It is optimized for 80% zoom. Further CSS adjustments might be necessary for consistent behavior.
- **Missing Assets**: Ensure the `assets` folder contains all the required images. Missing files may cause visual gaps.

## Future Improvements

- Add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., form validation, animations).
- Improve layout responsiveness for smaller devices.
- Optimize CSS for better zoom level compatibility.
